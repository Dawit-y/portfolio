					Hey there! 👋 I'm Dawit Yimer, a full-stack developer with a passion
					for building web applications that not only work flawlessly but also
					have a sprinkle of personality. I'm the kind of developer who thinks
					coding is like solving puzzles—except instead of missing pieces, you
					get unexpected bugs (but hey, that's the fun part, right?).
				</p>
				<p className="text-white mt-4 text-sm sm:text-base leading-relaxed">
					I have a love affair with Python, Django, JavaScript, React, NextJs
					and Node.js—basically, I'm all about making things work seamlessly,
					whether it's in the front-end or back-end (yes, I'm versatile like
					that).
				</p>
				<p className="text-white mt-4 text-sm sm:text-base leading-relaxed">
					When I'm not knee-deep in code, you'll probably find me binge-watching
					movies or chilling with friends while pretending I'm not secretly
					coding in my head. Because who needs a break when there are ideas to
					obsess over, right?
				</p>
				<p className="text-white mt-4 text-sm sm:text-base leading-relaxed">
					In short: I love turning complex problems into simple, user-friendly
					solutions and having a good laugh along the way.
