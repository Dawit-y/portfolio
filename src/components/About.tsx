          Hey there! ðŸ‘‹ I'm Dawit Yimer, a full-stack developer with a passion
          for building web applications that not only work flawlessly but also
          have a sprinkle of personality. Iâ€™m the kind of developer who thinks
          coding is like solving puzzlesâ€”except instead of missing pieces, you
          get unexpected bugs (but hey, that's the fun part, right?).
        </p>
        <p className="text-white mt-2">
          I have a love affair with Python, Django, JavaScript, React, NextJs
          and Node.jsâ€”basically, Iâ€™m all about making things work seamlessly,
          whether it's in the front-end or back-end (yes, Iâ€™m versatile like
          that).
        </p>
        <p className="text-white mt-2">
          When I'm not knee-deep in code, youâ€™ll probably find me binge-watching
          movies or chilling with friends while pretending Iâ€™m not secretly
          coding in my head. Because who needs a break when there are ideas to
          obsess over, right?
        </p>
        <p className="text-white mt-2">
          In short: I love turning complex problems into simple, user-friendly
          solutions and having a good laugh along the way.
        </p>
